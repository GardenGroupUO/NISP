What are delta energies?
########################

The delta energy is an estimate of the surface energy of a cluster. The delta energy is defined as:

.. math::

	\Delta = \frac{E - NE_{coh}}{N^{2/3}}

where :math:`\Delta` is the delta energy, :math:`E` is the energy of the cluster, :math:`N` is the number of atoms in the cluster, and :math:`E_{coh}` is the cohesive energy of a crystal lattice of the same metal that the clusters contain. The :math:`N^{2/3}` term is an estimate of the number of surface atoms that the cluster contains in a spherical cluster. The units of :math:`\Delta` are eV/atom, or eV per estimate number of surface atoms.
