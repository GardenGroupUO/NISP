What are delta energies?
########################

The delta energy is an estimate of the surface energy of a cluster. The delta energy is defined as:

\begin{equation}
\Delta = \frac{E - NE_{coh}}{N^{2/3}}
\end{equation}

where $\Delta$ is the delta energy, $E$ is the energy of the cluster, $N$ is the number of atoms in the cluster, and $E_{coh}$ is the cohesive energy of a crystal lattice of the same metal that the clusters contain. The $N^{2/3}$ term is an estimate of the number of surface atoms that the cluster contains in a spherical cluster. The units of $\Delta$ are eV/atom, or eV per estimate number of surface atoms.
