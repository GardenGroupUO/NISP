Examples of data that the NISP program gives
============================================

Once NISP has completed or once VASP is able to get or has been given all the energies of nanoclusters, NISP will give a set of plots and data. Examples of these can be found on the github page (`Click here to see examples of all of these plots and text files <https://github.com/GardenGroupUO/NISP/tree/main/Documentation/source/results>`_) and given below.


Firstly, NISP will output a series of plots and text files about various features of the nanoclusters. The first plot that is given is the interpolation scheme plot, which shows all the estimated energies of nanoclusters across the size range of nanoclusters that you are measuring across. An example of this for Au nanoclusters, using the RGL potetial with parameters from Baletto *et al.* `DOI: 10.1063/1.1448484 <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1448484>`_, is shown below:

The second plot is the same nterpolation scheme plot shown above, but with lines through it at the places that you want to obtain cluster with the particular number of atoms that you desire.

There are also a few text documents that are created by NISP. The first is a file called ``XX_Max_Size_YYYY_atoms_interpolation_scheme_results_file.txt``, where XX is the element of interest and YYYY is the max cluster size that were generated. This file contains the number of atoms, the base structure, and the delta energy of clusters generated by NISP. An example for Au nanoclusters, using the RGL potetial with parameters from Baletto *et al.* (`DOI: 10.1063/1.1448484 <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1448484>`_), is shown below:

Second, a number of ``XX_Max_Size_YYYY_Clusters_interpolated_at_size_ZZZ.txt`` are generated, where ZZZ are the size of the cluster that you wanted to obtain information about how to create. These are the number of atoms that are given in ``output_information['Sizes to obtain instructions to create clusters for']`` in the ``Interpolation_Script.py`` script (see `Output information for the interpolation scheme <Output_information_for_the_interpolation_scheme>`_). These text files give the information required to create all the various symmetric and unsymmetric icosahedral, decahedral, and octahedral clusters that may have compariable energies as predicted by NISP. An example for how to make Au nanoclusters with 742 atoms, using the RGL potetial with parameters from Baletto *et al.* (`DOI: 10.1063/1.1448484 <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1448484>`_), is shown below:
